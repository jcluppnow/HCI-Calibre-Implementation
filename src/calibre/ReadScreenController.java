But after forty \n\ndays without a fish the boy’s parents had told him that the old \n\nman was now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form \n\nof unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in \n\nanother boat which caught three good fish the first week.\n\nIt made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his \n\nskiff empty and he always went down to help him carry either the \n\ncoiled lines or the gaff and harpoonand the sail that was furled \n\naround the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, \n\nit looked like the flag of permanent defeat. ");

The blotches ran well down the sides of his face \n\nand his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling \n\nheavy fish on the cords. But none of these scars were fresh. \n\nThey were as old as erosions in a fishless desert. Everything \n\nabout him was old except his eyes and they were the same \n\ncolor as the sea and were cheerful and undefeated.\n\n“Santiago,” the boy said to him as they climbed the bank \n\nfrom where the skiff was hauled up. “I could go \n\nwith you again. We’ve made some money.");

I am a \n\nboy and I must obey him.” “I know,” the old man said. \n\n“It is quite normal.” “He hasn’t much faith.” \n\n“No,” the old man said. “But we have.
